# Coastal Connections: Tracking Wildlife on the California Coast
# In this project, I aim to explore the intricate connections between coastal habitats and adjacent marine systems by tracking wildlife using camera traps along the California coast. Through the integration of geographical, climate, and wildlife observation data, I seek to unravel the complexities of species distribution, abundance, and behavior in response to environmental factors.
